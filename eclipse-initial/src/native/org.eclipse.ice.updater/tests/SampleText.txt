Many new, high-performance nuclear energy modeling and simulation tools are under development in the United States and many more existing projects are moving to high-performance computing. This shift to state-of-the-art modeling and simulation will not only result in an unprecedented use of computing resources but it will generate extremely large amounts of data in extraordinary detail. Domain scientists will find themselves simultaneously in two positions: managing the complexity of their own problem domain and managing the complexity of a nightmarish scenario of high-performance computational complexity.
